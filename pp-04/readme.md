# Production Problem 04: Implementing HCI Guidelines for Touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android/Google, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).
Focus on touch-related elements.

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Android:
  https://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL):
https://material.io/guidelines/motion/material-motion.html#material-motion-implications-of-motion
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
When the user hits login, the following dashboard/profile screen slides in from the right.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL):
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn742479(v=vs.85).aspx
"If a window is contextual, always display it near the object that it was launched from."
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
When you mistype your password, a pop up appears instead of it taking you to an entire other page where you'll have to click another link in a completely different part of the page to take you back to the login screen.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL):
https://material.io/guidelines/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-touch-target-size
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
big ole button and big ole input things for ur giant fingers to click
