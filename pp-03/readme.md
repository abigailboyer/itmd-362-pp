1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kt+lZjcuHqmrQBxgKC+AW
Your Rationale:  red is a very video-game-color and these shades provide a decent amount of contrast for different uses

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=53+1q0kbEyn1fQ95jIhg1pFhIgn
Your Rationale: light pastels are spring colors and since it's a garden website it ought to have green on it because plants are green. the other colors are pink and a blue-ish lavender because those are flower-y colors.  

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3001l0kl1Wx1x+IcEXDsUWkWEVB
Your Rationale: the traditional baby alphabet colors are primary colors, so I chose a red/yellow/blue combination. oftentimes those colors will just be plain red, blue, and yellow, but I find those kind of jarring so I made them a bit pastel so it'd be more appealing.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13L1q0kmVxB6TWbgjJftUrKx7iI
Your Rationale: I figured that a website advertising a course isn't going to be extra with the fancy colors so I made the palette monochromatic. I made it blue because that's a calm education color and it's pretty.
