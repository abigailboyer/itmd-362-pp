# Production Problem 05: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability
problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is
to locate at least 2 different usability checklists each containing at least 25 items (use Google,
but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own,
condensed list of exactly ten items.

Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create
your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* URLs for the usability checklists you've found:

1. The page is easy to read and understand for all types of users.
2. The user can find what they're looking for easily.
3. The layout/text provides the user with visual cues about the content's order.
4. The navigation and hierarchy of content is intuitive and the user's steps are well directed from one place to the next.
5. Responsive design for all browsers.
6. Design, layout, and text should have a consistent theme across all pages.
7. All of the pages/fonts/images load quickly.
8. The forms are as simple as possible and easy to quickly fill out.
9. The website isn't cluttered and only contains necessary content.
10. The intentions and credibility of the website are transparent.
